# Fine-tuning a Model for Transliteration

## Introduction
You have a Facebook penfriend from Poland. His name is Alexandre, but it's  written as Aleksandre in Poland. Recently, he traveled abroad and posted a photo with Stany Zjednoczone (the United States) as the geolocation. You can't understand where he is since the geolocation is in Polish. This frustrates you, so you decide to fine-tune a transformers model so that all Polish names and toponyms are automatically anglicized.

In this project, you will learn how to fine-tune a T5 model to convert Polish names and locations into their English (anglicized) equivalents. You will gain practical skills in corpus creation, setting specific parameters for fine-tuning, monitoring the training process, and evaluating fine-tuning results.
